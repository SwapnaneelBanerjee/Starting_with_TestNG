Starting with TestNG

1. The TestNG Lifecycle (Annotations)

---> @BeforeSuite / @AfterSuite: Runs once for the entire project (good for database connections).

---> @BeforeTest / @AfterTest: Runs once for the <test> block in testng.xml.

@BeforeClass / @AfterClass: Runs once per Java class file.

@BeforeMethod / @AfterMethod: Runs before/after every @Test. (Best for opening/closing the browser to ensure test independence).
