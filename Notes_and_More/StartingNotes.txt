Starting with TestNG

1. The TestNG Lifecycle (Annotations)

---> @BeforeSuite / @AfterSuite: Runs once for the entire project (good for database connections).

---> @BeforeTest / @AfterTest: Runs once for the <test> block in testng.xml.

---> @BeforeClass / @AfterClass: Runs once per Java class file.

---> @BeforeMethod / @AfterMethod: Runs before/after every @Test. (Best for opening/closing the browser to ensure test independence).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Assertions 

---> Test Independence: Every test should be able to run alone. Do not make Test B depend on Test A being finished.

---> XML Management: Use testng.xml to group your tests, pass parameters, and control parallel execution rather than running individual Java files.

---> Avoid Hardcoding: Put your URLs and credentials in the @BeforeMethod or a properties file, not inside the @Test logic.

---> Prioritization: Use @Test(priority = 1) if you absolutely need a specific order, but try to design tests that don't care about order.

---> Reporting: TestNG generates a test-output folder automatically. Check emailable-report.html after your run to see a summary of passes and fails.
