Test Suite ---> Tests ---> Classes ---> Methods

* A Suite normally has multiple Tests
* A Test has multiple Classes 
* A Class can have multiple Test Methods

1. Suite 
What it is: The highest level in the TestNG hierarchy. A Suite represents a collection of multiple tests.
How it works: Defined in the XML by the <suite> tag. It allows you to manage global settings like parallel execution, thread counts, and shared parameters.
When it works: When you run a testng.xml file. It groups all the individual test classes into one execution report.
Key Attribute: parallel="tests" or parallel="classes" (allows running multiple tests at once).

2. Test 
What it is: A logical grouping of one or more classes within a suite.
How it works: Defined by the <test> tag in the XML. You might have one "Test" for "Chrome Browser" and another "Test" for "Firefox Browser," or one for "Smoke Module" and another for "Regression Module."
When it works: It acts as a filter. If you tell TestNG to run a specific <test> block, it only executes the classes inside that block.
Key Fact: Annotations like @BeforeTest and @AfterTest run before and after this specific block in the XML.

3. Class (The Container for Code, basic POJO)
What it is: A standard Java class file (e.g., LoginTest.java) that contains your test logic.
How it works: Classes are specified in the XML under the <classes> tag. TestNG creates an instance of this class to run the methods inside it.
When it works: When included in the XML or when you right-click the file to "Run as TestNG Test."
Key Annotation: @BeforeClass and @AfterClass run exactly once per class, regardless of how many test methods are inside.

4. Method 
What it is: An individual function inside a class. This is where the actual Selenium code lives.
How it works: Marked by the @Test annotation. Methods are the smallest unit of execution that can pass or fail.
When it works: Methods run according to their Priority or Alphabetical order.
Key Annotation: @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod. These are the most common; they run for every single method in the class (perfect for starting/stopping the browser).
