1. What is @Test? (Definition)
--->  It is the primary TestNG annotation used to mark a method as a Test Case.
Purpose: It tells the TestNG engine that the annotated method is not a regular helper method, but a piece of logic that should be executed and reported on (Pass/Fail).
Return Type: Methods marked with @Test must be public and should ideally return void.

2. How it Works (The Execution Process)
---> TestNG scans your project (or the TestNG Class) for the @Test marker.
It uses Reflection API to invoke these methods at runtime.
It wraps each test in a try-catch block internally:
If no exception occurs, the test is marked Passed.
If an AssertionError or any Exception occurs, it is marked Failed.
If a prerequisite is not met, it is marked Skipped.

3. When it Works (The Triggers)
---> A @Test method executes when:
You right-click the class and select Run as TestNG Test.
You run a testng.xml file that includes the class or package.
Its dependencies (if any) have successfully finished.
It is Enabled (the attribute enabled=true is the default).
